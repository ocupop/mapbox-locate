title: 'Built with Mapbox: Hackbox â€” Creative Misuse Cases'
summary: >-
  A beauty of the Mapbox ecosystem is its flexibility. Over the years, I've
  loved finding slightly unconventional ways to utilize our product. Or more
  importantly, the pluggability and flexibility of Mapbox tools and APIs have
  always made perfect sense for left-field "misuse cases". These "misuses" have
  led to a number of both fantastically frivolous AND incredibly useful
  projects, including: - Encoding elevation data into pictures - Post-punk
  elevation visualization (Joy Division elevation maps) - Visualizing when we'll
  be underwater - Animating weather data - Tiling non-geospatial data - Encoding
  data into efficiently striking formats - Axonometric point cloud maps -
  Borkenmaps, or: tweaking tiles for fun - 3D point cloud visualizations These
  are all non-traditional cross-pollinations of existing visualizations formats
  and data. Mapbox tools (from old-school tilemill to new-school studio) are the
  nexxus of transcendence. OK maybe that is a bit flowery, but the idea is this:
  you shouldn't let norms and traditions define your approach, and our tools
  help you get weird with ease.
