title: 'Built with Mapbox: Hackbox â€” Creative misuse cases'
summary: >-
  One of the beauties of the Mapbox ecosystem is its flexibility. Over the
  years, I've loved finding slightly unconventional ways to utilize our product.
  Or more importantly, the pluggability and flexibility of Mapbox tools and APIs
  have always made perfect sense for left-field "misuse cases." 


  These "misuses" have led to a number of both fantastically frivolous AND
  incredibly useful projects. Everything from encoding elevation data into
  pictures; post-punk elevation visualization (Joy Division elevation maps);
  visualizing when we'll be underwater; animating weather data; tiling
  non-geospatial data; encoding data into efficiently striking formats;
  axonometric point cloud maps; borkenmaps; tweaking tiles for fun; to 3D point
  cloud visualizations. These are all non-traditional cross-pollinations of
  existing visualizations formats and data. Mapbox tools (from old-school
  tilemill to new-school Studio) are the nexus of transcendence. OK, maybe that
  is a bit flowery, but the idea is this: you shouldn't let norms and traditions
  define your approach, and our tools help you get weird with ease.
