title: 'Unityâ€™s Map Quest: Barry Schuler'
summary: >-
  Barry bought MapQuest for $1.1 Billion in 1999 as President of AOL Interactive
  Services. He never put the maps on a CD, but he made a print interface that
  transformed our parents' lives. Now on the board of directors Unity after
  leading their $181 Million Series C as a partner at DFJ Growth Barry is
  redefining how we experience location again. And he has stories, you have to
  hear to believe.
