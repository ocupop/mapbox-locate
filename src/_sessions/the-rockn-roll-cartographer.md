title: The Rock N' Roll Cartographer
summary: >-
  Fans. Went. Nuts. Guns N’ Roses’ mega box set, Locked N’ Loaded launched, and Rock’n Roll Cartographer Lee Martin built it all. Underneath those skulls is a dark map of the user’s current location, designed around people sharing their love of GNR, this love of music, in the moment - in their town. Location has been at the heart of Lee Martin’s work in the music industry. Last year - Marilyn Manson fans woke up to a video of their house, accompanied by the audio of Manson’s single, “We know where you fucking live”, repeating as the satellite imagery spun like a record.
