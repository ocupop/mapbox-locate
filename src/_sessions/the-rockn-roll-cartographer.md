title: The Rock N' Roll Cartographer
summary: >-
  Fans. Went. Nuts. Guns N’ Roses’ mega box set, Locked N’ Loaded launched, and
  Rock n’ Roll Cartographer Lee Matin built it all. Underneath those skulls is a
  dark map of the user’s current location, designed around people sharing their
  love of GNR, this love of music, in the moment - in their town. Location has
  been at the heart of Lee Martin’s work in the music industry, last year -
  Marilyn Manson fans woke up to a video of their house, accompanied by the
  audio of Manson’s single, “We know where you fucking live,” repeating as the
  satellite imagery spun like a record. <br> <br> Hear how Lee is using maps to
  create mind-blowing experiences for users and putting location at the heart of
  the experience.
