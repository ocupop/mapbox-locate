title: The Rock N' Roll Cartographer
summary: >-
  Fans. Went. Nuts. Guns N’ Roses’ mega box set, Locked N’ Loaded, launched, and Rock N' Roll Cartographer Lee Martin built it all. Underneath those skulls is a dark map of the user’s current location, designed around people sharing their love of GNR, in the moment - in their town. Location has been at the heart of Lee Martin’s work in the music industry. Last year, Marilyn Manson fans woke up to a video of their house, accompanied by the audio of Manson’s single, “We know where you fucking live,” repeating as the satellite imagery spun like a record. Hear about Lee’s design process and how he built these incredible experiences.
