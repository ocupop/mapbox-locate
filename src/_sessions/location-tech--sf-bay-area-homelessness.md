title: Location Tech + SF Bay Area Homelessness
summary: >-
  Itâ€™s no secret that the SF Bay Area is experiencing an unprecedented housing
  crisis. Evictions are skyrocketing, price-related displacement is remapping
  entire neighborhoods, and a record number of people are living outdoors
  without access to sanitation or safe sleep. In this session, we're convening a
  group of local government officials, nonprofits, and engineers who have mapped
  similar need areas to talk about what solutions might exist in the data and
  mapping space.
