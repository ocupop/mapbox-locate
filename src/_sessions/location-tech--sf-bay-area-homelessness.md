title: Location Tech + SF Bay Area Homelessness
summary: >-
  Itâ€™s no secret that the SF Bay Area is experiencing an unprecedented housing crisis. Evictions are skyrocketing, price-related displacement is remapping entire neighborhoods, and a record-number of people are living outdoors without access to sanitation or safe sleep. Mapbox is convening a group of local government officials, nonprofits, and engineers who have mapped similar need areas to talk about what solutions might exist in the data and mapping space.
