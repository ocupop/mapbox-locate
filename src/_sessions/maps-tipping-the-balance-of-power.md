title: 'Maps tipping the balance of power: Indigenous People, Public Health, and Civic Engagement'
summary: >-
  We make maps for positive change on very different challenges. Emily Jacobi works with the Waoroni people of the Amazon defending the lands from oil and mineral exploration. Anya Aâ€™Hearn makes visualizations to fight malaria. Nathan Williams helps citizens connect to their government. What we all share is dissatisfaction with just a pretty map, and hold out to see the lives of people and our planet improve in a tangible way. Join us to discuss the tactics for creating data, designing cartography, and coding maps to tip the balance of power.
