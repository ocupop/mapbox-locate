title: 'Map-Free Reality: Location in a Post-Mobile World'
summary: >-
  As static 2D maps fade away with the bezels of mobile phones, the future
  interfaces for navigation and gaming exist in augmented reality. App
  developers need new frameworks and reality-grade location data to build the
  next generation of spatially-enabled augmented reality experiences. Itâ€™s
  harder than anything we have ever done in mapping to date. Hear the stories
  from the people building the invisible map and how they see AR permeating our
  daily experiences in the real world.
