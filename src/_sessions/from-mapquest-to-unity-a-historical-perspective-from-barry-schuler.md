title: 'Unityâ€™s Map Quest: Barry Schuler'
summary: >-
  Barry bought MapQuest for $1.1 Billion in 1999 as COO of AOL. He never put the
  maps on a CD, but he made a print interface that transformed our parent's
  lives. Now on the board of directors of Unity after leading their $181 Million
  Series C as a partner at DFJ Growth, Barry is redefining how we experience
  location again. And he has stories; you'll have to hear to believe.
