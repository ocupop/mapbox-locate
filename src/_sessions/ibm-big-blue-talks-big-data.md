summary: >-
  The way IBM has incorporated geospatial data in their solutions has evolved over the past decade. What started out as purely a data analytics capability built into their platform has become a much more curated content-first approach. Ron Baker, Director of Geospatial Content and Analysis at IBM, will walk through the history of this evolution and provide examples of how IBM is using realtime location data and weather predictions to expand their business today.
