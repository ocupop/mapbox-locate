Urbica is the team of developers, cartographers, designers and data analysts who worked with the Department of Transport of Moscow to track 812,000 rides across 300 stations. [Their detailed analysis](https://medium.com/the-data-experience/bicycles-in-the-city-f9529d918388) shows the pulse of the city, from the deep winter snow routes to tracking Michael Cohen. 

Aaron Williams of MapD will then cover how MapD optimized their geospatial analytics platform to be as lightweight and performant as possible.
