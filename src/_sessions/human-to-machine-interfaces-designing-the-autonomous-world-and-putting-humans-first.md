Tesla UX lead and Uber autonomous experience designer Brennan Boblett now leads Navigation Design at Mapbox. Brennan’s vision for driving experience has shaped a field. We’ve worked with Brennan since his time at Tesla leading and managing the UX design product across their luxury EV platform (Model S, X, 3), and Autopilot.

> “It’s the car and the software working harmoniously together to create a unique experience that can be felt even before you sit down in the car.”

Over his five years working side-by-side with Elon he set a new bar for the entire auto industry. More recently at Uber, Brennan built the autonomous vehicles passenger experience and helped design the navigation app for Uber drivers.
