title: 'Maps for Crisis and Growth. Experiences from the Field.'
summary: >-
  As the violence spread across Kenya in 2007, Eric Hersman watched the news surrounding the post-election violence back in his homeland and started coding. Three days later he had written a system that would allow anybody with a mobile phone to send in information and reports on what was happening around them. This was the co-founding of Ushahidi ("testimony" in Swahili), a crowdsourcing website created to map incidents of violence. The open source mapping software would be used tens of thousands of times, helping respond to the Haiti Earthquake to monitoring the Afghanistan elections. Eric would go on to be named a Senior TED Fellow, and he moved back home to founded iHub, Nairobi's tech innovation hub which Mark Zuckerberg speak at during his last trip in Africa. Now co-founder of BRCK, a 'backup generator for the internet' and one of the first hardware startups in Africa. Eric looks back at the early history of Crisis Mapping, and the movement that would go mainstream.
