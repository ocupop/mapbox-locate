summary: >-
  In one tap, your glasses turn into a camera and you hear a voice from hundreds
  of miles away in your right ear, “This is Stacy from Aira. What can I help you
  with?” Stacy is now looking through her terminal, seeing what is right in
  front of you, and where you are on the map. In this session, hear how AR and
  location services make real-world impact on thousands of people's lives.
