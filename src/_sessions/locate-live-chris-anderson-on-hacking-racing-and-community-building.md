summary: >-
  Learn how Chris is creating a new surface area for developers to start working
  on self-driving car tech, once again pairing open source projects and
  community events at the foundation of a new industry. 


  In 2007, Chris Anderson—NY Times best-selling author and at the time the
  editor-in-chief of Wired magazine—built his first drone at home with his kids
  using parts from a Lego Mind Machine. In 2012 he would co-found 3D Robotics,
  creating the world's largest community of DIY drone makers and the world’s
  leading open autopilot platform. Fast forward to today, Chris is CEO of 3DR,
  and now starting his latest side project, Donkeycar racing. Yes, the opening
  question will of be ‘Ok, WTF is a “Donkeycar”?’
