title: 'Democratization: The future of mapping'
summary: >-
  Maps, physical or digital, used to be built on static data, painstakingly
  collected by professionals and typically out of date by the time they hit
  public use. That changed when maps went mobile. Today, consumer expectations
  are that the map in your car or on your device reflects the world as it is.
  Right now. This fundamentally changes the market and puts a premium on
  real-time data and better resolution to drive services from traffic to ride
  sharing. Industry veterans Manik Gupta, VP of Product at Uber and Di-Ann
  Eisner, Director of Growth at Waze talk about how the market has evolved and
  how the next ten years of mapping will be radically different from the
  previous 2,000 years.
