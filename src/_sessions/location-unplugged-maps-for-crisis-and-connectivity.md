title: 'Location, Unplugged - Maps for Crisis and Connectivity'
summary: >-
  At Mapbox, weâ€™re building the live location platform for a hyper-connected future. But what is it like to work with location when people are disconnected? Two leaders in the use of technology for humanitarian response and development, Gabby Almon of NetHope and Erik Hersman of BRCK, share their experiences working with location data during times of crisis and in parts of the world with limited infrastructure. Join us for a reality-check and a call-to-action about using location tools when the going gets tough.
