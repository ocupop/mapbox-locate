  1. No GPS, no phones: Off-roading with Emily Miller 

  <br>

  Thirty-six all-women race teams. 2,000 kilometers. 8-day race across the
  desert. Hear how Emily Miller started The Rebelle Rally, a women’s endurance
  rally across the Nevada and California deserts. 

  <br>

  2. Earth-size explosions on the Sun. 

  <br>

  If we look up to the Sun, we see waves, sunquakes, flares, explosions - bigger
  than the whole Earth. Bruno shares the best shots he took when mapping the sun
  for NASA and explain why the sun has major explosions that could cripple the
  earth's utility grid, destroy the economy, and why taxpayers are funding NASA
  to map this live for early warning.
