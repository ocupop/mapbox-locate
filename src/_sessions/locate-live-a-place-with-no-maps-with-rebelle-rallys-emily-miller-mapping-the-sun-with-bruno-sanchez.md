  Locate Live: A place with no maps with Rebelle Rally’s Emily Miller & Mapping
  the Sun with Bruno Sanchez
summary: >-
  Why do you need a map when you're driving across 2,000 km of desert, without a
  map. How do you map a surface that is 92M miles away and 27M degrees
  Fahrenheit? Bruno Sanchez talks about mapping solar flares on the sun. And why
  he wanted to do that in the first place.
