title: Millimeter Precision HD Vector Maps
summary: >-
  Weâ€™re encoding HD Vector Maps that are precise down to millimeters of precision yet are highly compressed. Our Vector Tile specification provides variable precision and is designed to distribute large complex data and it is only set to be better. We are now building out the next version of our open source specification with the development of Vector Tile 3. This updated format will feature even higher levels of compression and unlock many other new possibilities. This will radically save bandwidth for streaming data to devices and reduces storage size for larger area coverage offline.
