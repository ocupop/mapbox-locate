title: Millimeter Precision HD Vector Maps
summary: >-
  Weâ€™re encoding HD Vector Maps that are precise down to millimeters of
  precision yet are highly compressed. Our Vector Tile specification provides
  variable accuracy and is designed to distribute large complex data, and it is
  only set to be better. We are now building out the next version of our open
  source specification with the development of Vector Tile 3. This updated
  format will feature even higher levels of compression and unlock many other
  new possibilities. This will radically save bandwidth for streaming data to
  devices and reduces storage size for larger area coverage offline. In this
  session, you'll get a look at how open source code has impacted this project
  and where it is going.
