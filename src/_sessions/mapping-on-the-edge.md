title: Mapping on the Edge
summary: >-
  Mapping used to be "on the edge" when it was in-car navigation. Then it moved
  to the cloud. Now, advances in microprocessors and tech like tensorflow
  processors are moving mapping back to the network edge where devices will
  interpret the world around them with new sensors. In this session, take a look
  at what coming microprocessor tech will do for mapping in AV, AR, and gaming.
