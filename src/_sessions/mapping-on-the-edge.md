title: Mapping on the Edge
summary: >-
  Mapping used to be on the edge when it was in-car navigation. Then it moved to
  the cloud. Now, advances in microprocessors and tech like TensorFlow
  processors are moving mapping back to the network edge where devices will
  interpret the world around them with new sensors. What will coming
  microprocessor tech do for mapping in AV, AR, and gaming?
