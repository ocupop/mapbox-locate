title: 'Built with Mapbox: Reactive apps with Mapbox GL JS'
summary: >-
  Learn how to use the Mapbox GL JS API in a "reactive" programming context.
  We'll use concrete examples to dig into some of the common issues and
  questions that come up when using Mapbox GL JS in a React application: can I
  declaratively set up the map layers and style? How should I handle events?
  What's the best way to hook up the map with React's component lifecycle? How
  can I coordinate state between the map and the rest of my app?
