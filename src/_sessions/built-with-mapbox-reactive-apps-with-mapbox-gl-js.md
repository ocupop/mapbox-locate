title: Reactive Apps with Mapbox GL JS
summary: >-
  This talk will take a look at how to use the Mapbox GL JS API in a "reactive"
  programming context. We'll use concrete examples to dig into some of the
  common issues and questions that come up when using Mapbox GL JS in a React
  application: Can I declaratively set up the map layers and style? How should I
  handle events? What's the best way to hook up the map with React's component
  lifecycle? How can I coordinate state between the map and the rest of my app?
