title: 'Middle Kingdom: 中国 Maps'
summary: >-
  The first thing you will notice is that the map is in Chinese, and then you will see a much larger South China Sea. What at first glance looks like just another map of China is layered in rich cartography and government approvals. Our China infrastructure is specifically designed to speed up Chinese mobile maps. The result is our maps are more than 10 times faster than other map providers, whether you are roaming on your international data plan or on wifi.
