title: A Map First World
summary: >-
  Maps and location are an integral part of consumer app experiences. Today’s
  consumers often need to know where something is, before they even need to know
  what it is. Location serves as the backbone for information displayed to the
  user, and a map-first UI can be more relevant than a list or text-first UI in
  many cases. In this session, we’ll deconstruct popular consumer apps to
  understand how they are integrating maps and location into their experiences
  to engage their users better.
