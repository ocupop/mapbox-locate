title: A map first world
summary: >-
  Maps used to be the last click in a consumer app: you'd scroll down a long
  list, find what you want, and only after looking for it on a map. But today's
  consumers expect apps to know where they are and orient the experience around
  their location. In this session, you'll hear how companies are designing and
  building map-first apps for today's consumers.
