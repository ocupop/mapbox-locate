title: 'LiDAR, Computer Vision, and the Software that Pulls them Together to Power Autonomous'
summary: >-
  If weâ€™re going to replace drivers in the car, technologies that allow sensing
  and perception are going to have to mimic the human ability to understand the
  environment, identify safe paths and react to changes in real time. The
  sensors that will enable this revolution are critical to making this a
  reality: LiDAR, computer vision, and the software that pulls them together.
  This panel will look at how those technologies will evolve with experts from
  the key fields.
