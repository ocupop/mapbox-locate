title: How Location Transforms IBM's Business
summary: >-
  The way IBM has incorporated geospatial data into their solutions has evolved
  over the past decade. What started out as purely a data analytics capability
  built into their platform has become a much more curated, content-first
  approach. Ron Baker, Director of Geospatial Content and Analysis at IBM, will
  walk through the history of this evolution and provide examples of how IBM is
  using real-time location data and weather predictions to expand their business
  today.
