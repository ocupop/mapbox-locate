title: Reactive Apps with GL JS
summary: >-
  Using GL JS API in a "reactive" programming context. Walk though concrete examples to dig into some of the common issues and questions that come up when using Mapbox GL JS in a React application: can I declaratively set up the map layers and style? How should I handle events? What's the best way to hook up the map with React's component lifecycle? How can I coordinate state between the map and the rest of my app?
