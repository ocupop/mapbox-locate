### The First Crash: Autonomous Driving History

Aaron Nathan co-led Cornell’s DARPA Grand and Urban Challenge teams, building two full scale autonomous vehicles capable of navigating in unrehearsed urban settings. Of the 89 teams to apply, 35 teams were invited. Aaron’s team was one of six to successfully complete the DARPA Urban Challenge. And he was the first one to have an autonomous vehicle crash.  Now as CEO and cofounder of Point One Navigation, a startup working on a precise location service specifically for autonomous vehicles, Aaron tells the story of that first epic moment. 

### Printers with frickin' laser beams

Glowforge is a 3D laser printer; a desktop laser cutter technology that transformed vector data, like maps, into 3D models. We’re excited to introduce… Dan Shapiro, who sold $27,907,995 on Kickstarter in 30-days, the largest crowdfunding campaign in history, to tell the story of printing maps with Glowforge. Of course there will be a live demo.
