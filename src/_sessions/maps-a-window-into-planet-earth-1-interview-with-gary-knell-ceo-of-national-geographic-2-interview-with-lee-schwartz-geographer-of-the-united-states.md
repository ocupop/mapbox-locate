title: 'Locate Live: A Window into Planet Earth with Gary Knell & Lee Schwartz'
summary: >-
  1. National Geographic Historical Map Collection  

  <br>

  Since the beginning of time, humans have been explorers. And since an 1889
  edition of the magazine, National Geographic has been making maps that tell of
  current events, give unique glimpses into historical events, and inform us
  about our world and our environment. Gary Knell led the privatization of
  National Geographic as part of a $1 billion sales to Rupert Murdoch at Fox,
  generating a unique revenue share giving the non-profit arm, National
  Geographic Society, long-term independence and the resources to map a whole
  new world. Hear Gary's unique perspective in this lightning talk.

  2. The Geographer of the United States of America

  <br>

  Maps can make events and changes in other parts of the world understandable to
  people where they are. Ira Ehrenpreis of DBL Partners talks with Gary Knell,
  CEO of National Geographic and Lee Schwartz, Geographer of the United States
  about how their organizations use maps to tell critical stories that affect
  the sustainability of the planet.

  An invasion of Costa Rica by Nicaragua at first looks like an error in Google
  maps. When the Ministry of Foreign Affairs complained to Google, it revealed
  the mapping data of the region was obtained from the U.S. Department of State.
  During this lightning talk, you'll hear from  Lee Schwartz, The Geographer of
  the United States of America (GOTUS), and head of the Humanitarian Information
  Unit (HIU), the mapping team at US State Department, managing official
  international country boundaries recognized by the U.S. Government.
