title: 'Wanted: Better Tools for a Better World'
summary: >-
  The power of location hinges upon data. Without data about where people and
  places are located, even the best map-based tools are out of reach. For
  organizations working on disaster response, humanitarian aid, and
  environmental protection around the world, this is a critical barrier to
  overcome. Hear from representatives of these organizations on how they're
  using location to power their response.
