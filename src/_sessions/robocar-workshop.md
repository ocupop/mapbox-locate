summary: >-
  In this four-hour Robocar Workshop, led by the DonkeyCar team, you'll build and race a small self-driving car. You'll be given a pre-assembled car (yours to keep!) and learn how to make it drive around manually to collect training data. Then you'll learn how to implement different types of autopilots and test them in a real track. The event will end with a race and prizes! <a href="https://locate.splashthat.com/workshop-robocar">Sign up now!</a>
