Caleb Kruse is a marine biologist and technologist. Growing up in landlocked Colorado Springs, his 90-gallon saltwater aquarium inspired him to study marine Biology at Stanford University. He was first named a National Geographic Explorer for creating The Ice Cream Expedition, a cross-country road trip in an ice cream truck to speak to children about exploration and conservation. Since then, he has worked with National Geographic on the Highest Road Expedition in the Indian Himalayas, launching a balloon 100,000 feet into the stratosphere to observe for the solar eclipse, and tracing the global supply chain of the marine aquarium fish trade on the Reef to Aquarium project. He currently works for Leap Motion, a computer vision company focused on virtual and augmented reality.
