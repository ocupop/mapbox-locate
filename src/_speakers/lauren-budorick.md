Lauren is on the Mapbox GL team, building the rendering engines that allow our users to make fast, beautiful, powerful maps. Sheâ€™s settled into graphics at Mapbox after spending a few years building Mapbox Studio and working on Project OSRM. Lauren studied public policy and studio art at Duke University, then learned to code at Hackbright Academy. Her first ever programming project was a routing engine for lazy runners like herself to avoid the treacherous hills of San Francisco and she's been building map technologies ever since.
