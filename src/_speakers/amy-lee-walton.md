Amy Lee is a designer at Mapbox. She brings visual narrative and systems-based design thinking to the cartography team. She designs beautiful maps, works on our core datasets, builds apps for testing and QA-ing our design releases, and often speaks to the design and GIS community about the space between design, narrative, and place.

Amy Lee holds an MFA in graphic design from the Maryland Institute College of Art (MICA). At MICA, Amy Lee coalesced traditional graphic design with physical computing, creative code, and digital fabrication. Born and raised in Southwest Ohio, Amy Lee only eats her chili over spaghetti and loves a good game of cornhole.
