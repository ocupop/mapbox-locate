Judd Schoenholtz is the Co-Founder and CEO of Open Listings. Judd and his wife bought their first home in 2011, and heâ€™s been singularly obsessed with fixing the homebuying process ever since. Before founding Open Listings, Judd was Group Director of User Experience at Huge, where he spent 10 years building an unrivaled, global digital agency (acquired by IPG) and designing products for Dell, IKEA, Samsung, Google, and, ironically, the National Association of Realtors. Judd holds a B.A. in Computer Science from Columbia University.
