Driven by a belief that outdated design and construction processes contribute to housing cost and the inequality plaguing our greatest cities, Ryan creates tools and research with a simple aim: build better faster. As head of Research + Innovation at one of the Pacific Northwest's largest general contractors, he leverages AR, machine-learning, collaborative cloud-based design and more, to transform processes for the better. With a Master of Architecture from the University of Oregon, Bachelor's degrees in Fine Arts and Psychology, and experience in software engineering and architecture, Ryan integrates diverse disciplines to change how buildings get made.
