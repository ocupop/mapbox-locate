Young is a designer turned engineer. As CTO, he serves the engineering teams at Mapbox, and focuses on growing individuals through support and mentorship. Heâ€™s worked on many parts of Mapbox, including rendering, geocoding, map data processing, and platform infrastructure.

Young was part of the original team at Development Seed that launched the first version of Mapbox after working in the mapping, open source, and tech space for many years. At Development Seed, Young was a visual designer until it became clear to him that making great product meant making things fast. He learned SQL to optimize back-end queries, and has since stopped trying to distinguish between back-end, frontend, system, visual, team, and organizational design.

Young is a graduate of Williams College with degrees in studio art and philosophy.
